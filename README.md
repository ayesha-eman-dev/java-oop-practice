# Java OOP Practice

This repository contains my **Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** practice programs from labs and exercises.  
The programs cover foundational OOP concepts including **classes, objects, constructors, overloading, encapsulation**, and simple Java basics.

## Folder Structure

- **basics/** → Lab 1: Simple Java programs and exercises  
  - MyFirstApp.java → First Java program  
  - Calculator.java → Simple calculator operations  
  - Circle.java → Calculate area of circle  
  - Rectangle.java → Rectangle class with area/perimeter methods  
  - RectangleTest.java → Test Rectangle calculations
    
- **encapsulation/** → Lab 1–2: Encapsulation example  
  - Student.java → Demonstrates private fields with getters/setters 

- **constructors/** → Lab 2: Constructor practice  
  - Product.java → Demonstrates default and parameterized constructors, static fields, getters/setters  
  - Demo.java → Test class for Product

- **constructorOverloading/** → Lab 3: Constructor overloading and copy constructor  
  - MemberCard.java → Demonstrates overloaded constructors, copy constructor, static fields/methods, and object management  
  - MemberCardDemo.java → Test class for MemberCard   

## Concepts Practiced

1. **Basics**
   - Creating classes and objects
   - Simple arithmetic operations
   - Area and perimeter calculations
   - Printing tables and finding maximum of two numbers
    
2. **Encapsulation**
   - Using **private fields** in a class
   - Accessing fields through **getter and setter methods**
   - Ensuring object data is safely modified

3. **Constructors**
   - Default constructor
   - Parameterized constructor
   - Static blocks
   - Getters and setters
   - Unique ID generation for objects

4. **constructorOverloading**
   - Constructor overloading
   - Copy constructors
   - Using overloaded constructors to simplify object creation
   - Activating/deactivating objects and updating fields via methods

## Notes for Users

- All `.java` files are **source code only**; compiled `.class` files are ignored.
- Programs currently use **hardcoded values**, as user input (Scanner) is not yet introduced.
- Each folder represents a **specific OOP concept** for clarity.
- This repository is **continuously updated** as I practice more Java OOP concepts.
